## Election-Audit Summary

This script can easily be repurposed moving foward in future election. All that would need to be changed is the column number referred to when collecting the candidate names and county names within the script. Thus, the current script
could be used in another csv file similar to the one in this analysis by simply changing 2 numbers. Additionally, just as we repurposed the candidate count code to write the county count code we could very easily write another count. For 
example, a procedure could easily be written to find out the testing site which recieved the highest traffic during the election if the data was provided/collected.
